============================

This project evaluates the performance of a diabetes prediction algorithm using various classifiers.
Context: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.
The dataset included 7 predictor variables: Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThick-ness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age.
Content: Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
